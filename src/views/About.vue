        <p class="intro">To start off I am 21 years old, I've lived in Cleveland, 
        Ohio all my life and been coding since I was 17. 
        I enjoy this city and all that it's done for me. 
        It's the place that has taught me many of life's lessons, 
        it's the place where I learned what it means to persevere. 
        Cleveland really is a great city with a lot to offer entertainment, 
        history, art and these are just the tip of the iceberg. 
        The potential this city has is limited only by what one can imagine. 
        I see a future where people view Cleveland as a technological powerhouse. 
        I want the best for my city... my home.
        I don't want this vision to stay a dream. I plan on 
        doing my part and all I can do to make it reality.

        The first way I plan on helping Cleveland business 
        is first getting mom and pop shops online and back in 
        healthy competition against these bigger corporations. 
        It's the first step and it's important for businesses of 
        any kind to have the ability to innovate and expand. That 
        is exactly the opportunity that is created once your business 
        is available online. Reach customers, leads, views or whatever your 
        business needs to eat and grow all with the power of online outreach.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the internet always changing on what it takes to stay in the 
        loop and maintain web traffic. It’s a job completely on its own,
        it's no longer just making a facebook page. Today, you need to 
        not only have a Facebook page but a list of other credentials
        as well. Having your own space on the internet is a big step
        in the right direction. Next is making sure you're consistent
        with your site just like any other part of your business. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For instance, if your business uses trucks then you need to 
        make sure your trucks are maintained and used properly or you 
        wont get much out of it. The same practice should apply to your 
        website to get the most out of it. Once your site is up it's 
        important to keep up with it. Tasks like posting more pages, 
        backlinks, updating pictures, and so many more other things
        go after the creation of your site. That is why it's a good 
        investment to bring someone in order to do this work for your 
        business.

         I want to grow with Cleveland and help those looking to 
        do the same. I’ve learned to take my passion for computers, 
        code, online projects and combine with my enthusiasm for 
        Cleveland. When people think of Cleveland I want them to 
        think of growing businesses. Yes I know that is ambitious 
        of me to say but I think it's possible. The ability for me 
        to grow alongside this great is possible and the same goes 
        for anyone looking to do the same. That is why I started this 
        venture to help people see the change and growth in their 
        business but also their communities.

          With my knowledge of coding and ability to be creative with 
          problem solving and with presentations guarantees the websites 
          that I create are all unique. The look and feel of the website 
          plays a big role in the success of said website. Just as big a 
          role as the information presented. This is why I take pride in 
          coming up with new and unique layouts, templates, and designs 
          for my sites. Making a site that is memorable, easy to navigate,
          and displays the information in an easy to read fashion is a 
          skill set in demand for any company looking to grow.

          SEO is also a huge part of what I can do for you small business. 
          Researching keywords and coming up with new pages to generate more 
          traffic to your site. Generating consistent content also needs to 
          be considered when getting a site more traffic. Of course this 
          takes time and knowledge of what to look for to get more people
          on your site. Fortunately, I've read up on google analytics 
          and what google looks for when ranking your site. My expertise 
          in this field will allow your company to grow constantly while 
          saving you time to focus on other parts of your business.
